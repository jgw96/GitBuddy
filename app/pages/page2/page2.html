            GitNinja allows you to easily and instantly search through the most popular Github repos! You can search two ways, either
            by entering something like "chat, typescript" which will search for repos that are chat applications written
            in typescript, or just enter simple search terms like "chat" or "python" etc. You can also search users by name,
            this will automatically pull users with that name that have atleast 30 followers and 3 repos!
